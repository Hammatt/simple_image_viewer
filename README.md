# Simple Image Viewer

Designed to be just a really simple image viewer because the windows 10 default one was too slow and I just wanted something that worked and this was the quickest thing i could think of to solve my problems.

## TODO
 - support more file types (glob for more than just png)
 - keyboard shortcuts for left and right too
 - fix issue where window gets too big to fit on screen and can't press any buttons any more
